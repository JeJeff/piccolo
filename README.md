# Piccolo Macropads
These are mini macropads intended for video conference control.  Setup by default for Zoom, it could be used to Teams, Webex, or any other video conference system with keyboard shortcuts just by changing the keymapping.  And of course you can repurpose it for anything else you feel like.

The [Piccolo](https://github.com/JeJeff/piccolo/tree/main/piccolo) has 5 buttons, or 4 buttons and a rotary encoder, and an OLED screen.

The [Piccolo Mini](https://github.com/JeJeff/piccolo/tree/main/piccolo-mini) is the same but without the screen.

## Current Status
The Piccolo has a working prototype, and revision 2 (including FR4 switch- and back-plates) is ready for ordering.
The Piccolo mini is not yet prototyped.  Work on this is paused until the bigger brother is ready for release.
