# Piccolo Zoom controller
Piccolo is a mini macropad intended for video conference control.  Setup by default for Zoom, it could be used to Teams, Webex, or any other video conference system with keyboard shortcuts just by changing the keymapping.  And of course you can repurpose it for anything else you feel like.

## Key features
* 5 key macro pad
* Supports MX style switches
* Hot swap sockets
* OLED screen
* Optional rotary encoder replacing one of the keys
* QMK controlled
* Easy to solder

## Additional information
 * 2 layer PCB
 * Switchplate and backplate designs available
 * Both throughhole and SMD diodes supported
