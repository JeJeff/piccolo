# Piccolo Macropads
These are mini macropads intended for video conference control.  Setup by default for Zoom, it could be used to Teams, Webex, or any other video conference system (or anything else) with keyboard shortcuts just by changing the keymapping.

The [Piccolo Macropad](https://github.com/JeJeff/piccolo/tree/main/piccolo) has 5 buttons, or 4 buttons and a rotary encoder, and an OLED screen.

The [Piccolo Mini Macropad](https://github.com/JeJeff/piccolo/tree/main/piccolo-mini) is the same but without the screen.

## Current Status
### Piccolo
The Piccolo has a working prototype, and revision 2 (including FR4 switch- and back-plates) is ready for ordering.

### Piccolo Mini
The Piccolo mini is designed not yet prototyped.  Work on this is paused until the bigger brother is ready for release.
